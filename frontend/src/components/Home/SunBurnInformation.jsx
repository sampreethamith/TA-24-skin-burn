          <h3>UV rays</h3>
          <p className="white-text home-information-font">
            There are two kinds of UV rays that can harm the skin:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>UVA plays an important role in premature skin aging.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>UVB rays are responsible for the cause of sunburn.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            When buying sunscreen, choose broad-spectrum sunscreen which could
            prevent UVA and UVB rays. Also, the sun protection factor (SPF)
            should not be less than 15.

          <h3>SPF Level</h3>
          <p className="white-text home-information-font">
            {" "}
            SPF is the level of how well the sunscreen could prevent the sun.
            The SPF number could tell you how long the sunâ€™s UV radiation will
            take to redden your skin. In the ideal circumstance, a person with
            SPF 30 sunscreen will need 30 times longer to burn than without
            using any sunscreen. The calculation of it is:
          </p>
          <p className="white-text home-information-font">
            {" "}
            SPF = sunburn radiation dose with sunscreen / sunburn radiation dose
            without sunscreen
          </p>
          <p className="white-text home-information-font">
            {" "}
            Here is the description of each SPF level:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>SPF 15 prevents around 93% of all UVB rays.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>SPF 30 prevents around 97%.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>SPF 50 is an almost complete UVB block at 98%.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            People who have a history or high potential risk of skin cancer,
            genetic diseases like albinism or xeroderma pigmentosum should apply
            higher SPF products. SPF 50 still could not meet their requirement.

          <h2>What to look for when buying sunscreen?</h2>
          <p className="white-text home-information-font">
            {" "}
            Read clearly about the product labels. Look for a waterproof product
            if you are going to swim or sweat. A non-stinging product for your
            face is important. Try another sunscreen if your skin has a bad
            reflection of the one that you currently have. For example, buy a
            product that does not include para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) if you
            are sensitive to this ingredient. Try water-based sunscreen if you
            have oily skin or are prone to acne.

          <h3>Time/When</h3>
          <p className="white-text home-information-font">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Apply sunscreen 15-30 mintues before going outside. It will
                  let sunscreen better protect yourself.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours or immediately after you
                  finish swimming or sweating (strenuous exercise). There has no
                  evidence to show that any sunscreen could offer entire day
                  protection or be completely waterproof.{" "}

          <h3>How?</h3>

                  For traditional sunscreen, shake well before using the
                  sunscreen to ensure the particles which clumped up within the
                  container could be mixed up. Spray-on sunscreen would be a
                  good choice as a new type of sunscreen.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Apply enough sunscreen. Make sure the sunscreen is applied
                  thickly. Traditionally, for adult needs an ounce to fully
                  cover the body.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Apply sunscreen to all skin which is exposed to the sunshine.
                  Not only face and hands, but also neck, ears, feet and legs.

              </li>
              <li>

                  Pay attention to the expiration date of the product. The
